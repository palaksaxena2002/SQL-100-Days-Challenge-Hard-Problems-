Zomato's delivery system encountered an issue where each item's order was swapped with the next item's order. 
Your task is to correct this swapping error and return the proper pairing of order IDs and items. 
If the last item has an odd order ID, it should remain as the last item in the corrected data.
Write an SQL query to correct the swapping error and produce the corrected order pairs.

-- create statement
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS orders;
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    item VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO orders (order_id, item) VALUES
(1, 'Chow Mein'),
(2, 'Pizza'),
(3, 'Veg Nuggets'),
(4, 'Paneer Butter Masala'),
(5, 'Spring Rolls'),
(6, 'Veg Burger'),
(7, 'Paneer Tikka');

            THEN order_id + 1
        WHEN order_id % 2 <> 0 AND order_id = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders) 
            THEN order_id
        ELSE order_id - 1
